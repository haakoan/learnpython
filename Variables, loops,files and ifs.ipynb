    "## Variables\n",
    "A variable can be thought of as a box that in which you can store information for later. The computor\n",
    "keeps the variable in memory and you can acess it by refering to its name later in the program. You are\n",
    "free to change the content of a variable, but some languages have a extra type of variables, constant variables, \n",
    "that can not be changed while the program is running\n",
    "\n",
    "In most languages, variables are assigned content using the assignment operator \"=\". For example, pi = 3.14. \n",
    "The equal sign does, therefore, not have the meaning we are used to from math. This will become clear later when we\n",
    "look at IFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arrays\n",
    "Often you want to keep track of multiple variables, for example the position of a particle in three dimensions (x,y,z).\n",
    "One solution is to define three variables ( x, y, and z ), but one can also define r = (x,y,z).\n",
    "Python has three built-in array types. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Tupels\n",
    "In python a tuple is a type of array that can not be changed after assigning it. It is denoted \n",
    "tuple = (a,b,c,d).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lists\n",
    "Lists, in pyhon, are arrays that can be changed in run time. They are defined in a similar way as tuples, but\n",
    "use square brackets.\n",
    "list = [a,b,c,d].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictonaires\n",
    "Dictonaris are defined by paris of keys and values.\n",
    "dict = {\"height\" : 1.85, \"age\" : 33, \"name\" : \"Haakon\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "The elements of tuples and lists are accesed by what is known as indexing, in other words to get the first\n",
    "element of list you write list[0]. Note that python counts from 0. In a dictonary you acess the value you are interested\n",
    "in by looking up the key dict[\"name\"] will return \"Haakon\". Think about it as looking up a entry in a traditional dictonary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A side note on types\n",
    "Types, what you are working with is important because computors are not very clever. There is a difference between a number and a text string. In python strings are defined by using either '' or \"\". Importantly this means that 6 is not the same as '6'.\n",
    "Obviosuly, it would not make sense to add the number 4 and the character c. We intutivly understand this, but a computor needs rigrous rules. \n",
    "\n",
    "a = 6 \\\n",
    "b = \"a\" \\\n",
    "c = a+b \n",
    "\n",
