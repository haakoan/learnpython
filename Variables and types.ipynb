    "# Variables\n",
    "A variable is just a box in which the computor can store information, a list is is simply a sequence of\n",
    "variables stored in larger box.\n",

    "The goal of this exercise is to practise how to define variables, tuples, and lists. You will also learn about different data types and the basic rules for variables in Python. \n",

    "### Tupels\n",
    "In python, a tuple is a type of array that can not be changed after assigning it. It is denoted \n",
    "tuple = (a,b,c,d).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lists\n",
    "Lists, in python, are arrays that can be changed in run time. They are defined similarly to tuples but\n",
    "use square brackets.\n",
    "list = [a,b,c,d].\n",

    "### Dictonaires\n",
    "Dictionaries are defined by pairs of keys and values.\n",

    "\n",
    "The elements of tuples and lists are accessed by what is known as indexing, in other words, to get the first\n",
    "element of a list you write list[0]. Note that python counts from 0. In a dictionary, you access the value you are interested\n",
    "in by looking up the key dict[\"name\"] will return \"Haakon\". Think about it as looking up an entry in a traditional dictionary.\n",
